# Pi-Digit-Handwriting-Training-and-Test
Digit Recognition on Pi using Convolutional Neural Network using Keras/TensorFlow. Pi model 4 is what the code is written for. Pi needs to be set up before this code can be excecuted. Pi also needs all libraries such as numpy, tensorflow, pi camera, cv2, and sensehat. Pi hardware that needs to be included is a compatible camera and LED sensehat. Model needs to be created and network needs to be trained either on Pi or external computer. Test file needs to be run on Pi.
